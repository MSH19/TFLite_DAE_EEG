The Autoencoder_revision folder contains the original trained model on PC using Python.                    

To convert the model to TFLite models, use the script named tflite_conversion. The script also loads the noisy and clean data and exports them to text files (optional).     

To convert the TFLite models to header files, use the commands included in the convert_to_header.ipynb file.
